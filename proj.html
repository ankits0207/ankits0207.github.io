		<h3>Balanced Session based Recommendation Systems for robustness to changing environments, TCS R&I Labs</a></h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
				Popularity bias in Recommendation Systems pose serious problems when less popular/new items are present. This hurts even more in scenarios having covariate shift in terms of user distribution. A robust and balanced Deep Learning based Recommendation System was proposed which showed significant gains wrt click/buy rate even when user distribution changes.

		<h3>Effect of lockdown interventions to control the COVID-19 epidemic in India, TCS R&I Labs</a></h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
				Different lockdown intervention strategies/agents to control the spread of COVID-19 virus were studied and their impact was compared in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. A simulator was built using detailed demographic data and several agents were compared one of which was a Reinforcement Learning based Deep Q Learning agent.

		<h3>Ad/Offer effect estimation in high dimensions, TCS R&I Labs</a></h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
				A Deep Learning based solution was proposed which was designed to estimate the incremental effect of an ad/offer in scenarios where covariates are high dimensional and number of ad/offers is large. SOTA results were obtained on benchmark datasets.

		<h3>Meta-Learning for ad/offer effect estimation, TCS R&I Labs</a></h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
				Observational data accrued from multiple homogeneous subgroups of a heterogeneous population can be used to meta-learn a model which would generalize well in cases when training set is small. MetaCI was proposed as a Deep Learning based solution in ad/offer effect estimation use case. Significant gains were reported as compared to other methods.
